# API_tests

The repository holds the piece of code, representing my contribution to developing our own testing framework, using Python Pytest module.

I am a member of the team, developing firmware for IP devices (intercoms, cameras, audio speakers, access units, answering units). Besides, we develop mobile applications, software control system and cloud service as a part of complex solution we offer our customers. So, I also deal with testing our IP devices with other company products, as well as with third-party products.

The API_tests project is devoted to the testing framework development. The framework is used for creating api_tests and functional tests. For now, we test everything through back-end. 

The project contains much more modules, but I have uploaded only the parts, I have coded.

Also, I am working on a web application in Python (Flask), which allows us to run tests on multiple devices at a time, display test reports in browser, create automatic testruns in testrail and send test results there. This application is deployed on one of or our Linux virtual machines, but its functions are dynamically updated according to our testing strategy.

I have also uploaded a couple of automated API testing suits, I have written.
